This project contains (core) business services and service methods; application specific services should be 
part of the application itself (i.e. quotation related services would be here, but capital cost overview 
service should be in the vision project). 

This code was made core after the driver module was completed and as such there were a few services
that were cross coupled (had generic or were used by generic/core services/service methods but also had Vision specific 
code. They are LookupCacheService, NotificationService, UserService and DriverService. They should be revisited
when time permits and risk is less.
